# 30DayMapChallenge

#30DayMapChallenge is a map making challenge happening every November. People around the world makes map and share it on Twitter.  
<br>For each day, there is a theme and anybody can make map based on that theme. It is not mandatory to complete all the 30 maps. But the idea is to enjoy the process. 
<br> <br> The maps can be tracked on Twitter with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/30DayMapChallenge?src=hashtag_click">#30daymapchallenge</a>  
<br>Official website for the challenge: <a href="https://30daymapchallenge.com/">30daymapchallenge.com</a>
<br><br> This repository will contain my contributions to the map challenge.
